Everyday Object Sustainability Classifier
📌 Project Overview

The Everyday Object Sustainability Classifier is a machine learning + AI powered web application that helps classify everyday objects into sustainability categories such as plastic, glass, metal, paper, biological waste, etc.
The project is built using Python, Streamlit, and Gemini API, and allows users to upload images of objects and receive sustainability-based classification predictions.
This project aims to spread awareness about waste segregation and environmental sustainability using AI.

🎯 Objectives

Promote environmental awareness using technology.
Classify everyday waste objects into correct sustainability categories.
Provide an easy-to-use web interface for real-time predictions.
Demonstrate integration of AI APIs into real-world applications.
